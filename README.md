# spring-security
Enable basic authentication for a project

- All you have to do is enable basic auth in [WebSecurityConfig](https://github.com/isharafe/spring-security/blob/basic-auth/src/main/java/com/ruchira/learn/springsecurity/config/WebSecurityConfig.java)
- This example uses in memory user authentication, i.e. spring it self generate a user and a password. default user is **user** and password in logged to the console
